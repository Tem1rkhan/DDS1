            </p>
            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Digital Devil Saga</b> follows the Embryon, a tribe who fights
              against five other tribes in a digital world called the Junkyard.
              After being infected with a demon virus that grants them demonic
              powers, the Embryon must fight with and devour the other tribes to
              ascend to "Nirvana". During the conflict, they shelter a woman
              named Sera, who has the power to calm their demonic powers. In
              <b>Digital Devil Saga 2</b>, having escaped into the devastated
              real world, the Embryon are caught up in the fight against the
              Karma Society, who are intimately linked to the source of the
              disaster. The gameplay of both titles feature third-person
              navigation of playable characters around to-scale environments,
              and turn-based gameplay against demonic monsters and human
              enemies.

                <hr />
                <p>
                  During a border skirmish between the Embryon and the
                  Vanguards, a demon virus is introduced that infects everyone
                  in the Junkyard: branded with a mark representing their "Atma"
                  and gradually awakening to basic emotions, the people of the
                  Junkyard must devour their foes to satiate their demonic
                  hunger or risk going berserk. Sera, a so-called cyber shaman,
                  arrives suffering from amnesia and is taken in by the Embryon,
                  revealing herself capable of calming their hunger with her
                  singing. The Embryon first become conscious of their new
                  powers when they meet the surviving Vanguard: during their
                  time there, they are forced to kill the Vanguards' leader
                  Harley. Serph is then summoned to the Karma Temple along with
                  the surviving tribe leaders. Once they are assembled there, a
                  female being calling itself Angel orders the tribes to conquer
                  their neighbors and ascend the Temple's tower to "Nirvana",
                  bringing Sera as proof of their achievements. The Embryon
                  decide to ally with the Maribel as a means of defeating the
                  stronger tribes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After gaining the trust of the Maribel's leader Jinana, they
                  are betrayed by her second-in-command Bat, who allies with the
                  Brutes along with the Solids' leader Mick. Jinana, having
                  refused to eat as she needed to, goes berserk and must be
                  killed. The Solids then capture Sera, leading the Embryon into
                  a fight to the death against Mick. They also successfully
                  trick the Brutes' forces and Bat into a booby-trapped ship,
                  killing them. During this time, the Wolves are subdued by the
                  Brutes, whose leader Varin has awakened memories of a former
                  life where he was known as "Colonel Beck", and unsuccessfully
                  attempted to persuade Angel to release him from the Junkyard.
                  With help from the Wolves' deposed leader Lupa, the Embryon
                  infiltrate the Brutes' castle, but Lupa is killed after going
                  berserk. Later, the Embryon end up fighting Varin, who accuses
                  Sera of being a monster before he dies. Sera regains her
                  memories and runs to the Karma Temple with the Embryon in
                  pursuit. There, Sera faces the human form of Angel, who
                  threatens to delete the Junkyard with a computer virus if Sera
                  does not return to the real world with her. The Embryon arrive
                  and successfully fight Angel, but in the process release the
                  computer virus. The Embryon, Sera and Angel only just escape
                  as the Junkyard is destroyed.

                <h3>Digital Devil Saga 2</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  In Digital Devil Saga 2, the Embryon appear in the real world,
                  which is slowly being destroyed by the Black Sun: the only
                  ones able to survive the sun's rays are those infected with
                  the demon virus. Serph, Cielo, Argilla and Gale learn that
                  Sera is the captive of Angel and Madame Cuvier at the Karma
                  Society headquarters. With the help of Roland and a young boy
                  named Fred, the group infiltrate the Karma Society's building.
                  While they attempt to rescue Serah, Angel plans to subvert
                  Cuvier and use the demon virus to create a society ruled by
                  the strong. The Embryon are also faced by Heat, who is working
                  with Cuvier on the promise of Sera's safety. Reaching the EGG,
                  a man-made replica of God, the party rescue Sera, but Heat
                  appears and seems to kill Serph. Both fall into the EGG, and
                  God begins absorbing the Earth's data: in the chaos, Angel
                  kills Cuvier, while the remaining Embryon and Sera, now able
                  to assume a demon form herself, shut down the Power Plant in
                  an unsuccessful attempt to stop the EGG. In the process, both
                  Roland and Argilla are killed by a powerful demon. Returning
                  to the EGG so Sera can speak with God, they are confronted by
                  Heat, who has fused with the EGG and gone berserk. Inside the
                  EGG, Serph is met by a higher being calling itself
                  Schrödinger, who reveals the truth about what happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Karma Society was founded to study God, who was losing his
                  faith in humanity due to their behavior. Sera was the only
                  survivor of a group of children with the ability to
                  communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the
                  experiments, Sera created an artificial environment populated
                  by benign versions of Karma Society staff: this environment
                  was redesigned to become the Junkyard and the artificial
                  beings would become its five tribes. The original Serph
                  manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the
                  original Heat attempted to protect her. When Sera saw Serph
                  killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and
                  attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood
                  of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing
                  the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the
                  process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma
                  facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies
                  defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and
                  Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins
                  transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph.
                  Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of
                  God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the
                  data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an
                  avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph
                  achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new
                  worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's
                  end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera
                  and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their
                  caretaker.

                  <span>Megami Tensei</span>, marketed internationally as
                  <span>Shin Megami Tensei</span>, is a Japanese media franchise
                  created by Aya Nishitani, Kouji "Cozy" Okada, Ginichiro
                  Suzuki, and Kazunari Suzuki. Primarily developed and published
                  by Atlus, and currently owned by Atlus, the franchise consists
                  of multiple subseries and covers multiple role-playing genres
                  including tactical role-playing, action role-playing, and
                  massively multiplayer online role-playing. The first two
                  titles in the series were published by Bandai Namco, but have
                  been almost always published by Atlus in Japan and North
                  America since the release of Shin Megami Tensei.

                  Most Megami Tensei titles are stand-alone entries with their
                  own stories and characters. Recurring elements include plot
                  themes, a story shaped by the player's choices, and the
                  ability to fight using and often recruit creatures to aid the
                  player in battle. Elements of philosophy, religion, occultism,
                  and science fiction have all been incorporated into the series
                  at different times.
